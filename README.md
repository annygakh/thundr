Summary of Application:

The purpose of this project is to provide UBC students with an interactive online platform that allows an ease of access towards courses and their related information organized in a concise yet detailed manner, where the worklist and course selections made in previous logins would be saved under their Facebook accounts. The web application is flexible towards the user's viewing preferences, providing various options such as list representations of the course choices, correlated prerequisites, and even potential "post-requisites" (courses that require the selected course as a prerequisite i.e. course that are "unlocked" upon completion of the selected course) in relevance towards respective worklist tailored by the user.

The application also provides user-friend services to aid browsing through courses provided by UBC. The process is complemented by filtering options such as course section, professor, start time, location, etc., where multiple selections could be made. The system will then return the relevant information, where upon the inability to identify relevant courses, would then return a warning message to notify the user. Similarly, notifications will be made upon various scenarios such as conflicting scheduling, attempts at registering for full/blocked sections, courses restrictions, etc.
