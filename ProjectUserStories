acceptance criteria:
// ANNY: THIS IS ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR COURSE/LAB/TUTORIAL SECTIONS
// anny: i changed it from course -> to a course section, lab section and a tutorial section, because if we want to search by time, 
// then,  logically, we are interested in sections themselves, and not just the course. feel free to change it back, 
// naomi: true, or we can stalk random ppl by searching for their lecture/lab/tutorial time XD
// anny: omg!!
